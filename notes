Frete dating_app v.1 notes

    Problems:
        1 - Difficult to work with classes. How to add profiles to a 'liked list users'?
            I've created a method called 'like person' that should take only one argument ('profile'),
            but in fact it take two ('self' and 'profile').

            I thought one way

        2 - How to check for matching users?

    Improvings:
        1 - Login system
        2 - DataBase implementation
